When I first heard of minimalism a couple of years ago, I was SUPER intrigued!  I think it was my introduction to Marie Kondo’s amazing book, The Life-changing Magic of Tidying Up, that started my purging.  I immediately ran through the house (a townhome in Utah), and got rid of a bunch of stuff.  But throughout the next few years, I kept getting inspired, purging, dropping it off at Goodwill, but everything stayed the exact same! Still so much stuff!  I was on a crazy cycle.  My husband would groan when I begged him to go through his t-shirts... “just one more time?” :)

Seeing the pictures of those beautiful Pinterest-worthy empty rooms online, had me drooling, yet I couldn’t get my own home simple, clean or organized.  With 4 homeschooled children, we had everything from books, artist supplies, workout gear and tubs of baby clothes!  After getting inspired yet again in our home in North Carolina, we decided we no longer needed a bed frame, and literally chopped up our black iKea frame and tossed it away.  (We loved our bed sitting on the floor actually, but we had to buy a frame again when we moved to Phoenix, because…..hello scorpions! **shudder**)  Having to pack up ALL our stuff every time we wanted to move was getting annoying.  “Can’t we just accidentally have a house fire and start over??” (Exact quote from me...)



But it wasn’t until this strange year of 2020, that we decided to take things seriously.  With Mr. Minimalist working from home full-time, we began hatching our plan.  What if we sold everything and began full time traveling?  We had talked about this so many times but Mr. M. wasn’t ever on board with it until now.  I’m not sure what switched for him, but I think it was after reading The Four Hour Workweek, that he began to see his 9-5 as more of a burden than a blessing.  While he was super grateful to continue to have his job, it just opened his eyes to see that there were more flexible ways to earn an income that didn’t require you to be glued to your office chair 40 hours long hours a week.  Diving into the idea of thinking outside the box, led us to start dreaming of full time traveling, which naturally led straight into extreme minimalism.  Will this item fit in a suitcase?   When we decided it was time to try something new, we jumped right in and started selling everything!  



**My Biggest Lesson Learned Through Minimalism (so far!)**



What did you get for your birthday last year?  What did you get for Christmas two years ago?  If you are anything like me, I have no clue what I got for my birthday!  (Sorry, Babe!)  While I am sure it was a special gift, the actual items aren’t the best part of the birthday or holiday.  **Spending time with those closest to you is more enjoyable than finding a new home for your pile of gifts.**  After coming upon this photo of our girls sitting on the moving truck, I realized all the years we had spent hauling our stuff from home to home, was just nauseating.  Not that I didn’t like our stuff, it was just that…..I didn’t like our stuff as much as I thought I did.

As our home gets more empty by the day, I find that I am not only throwing away/giving away wasted items of no value or joy, **I am finding instead more time to happily relax on our one couch without feeling like I need to go clean something.**
